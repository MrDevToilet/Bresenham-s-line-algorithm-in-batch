# Bresenham's line algorithm made inside of the batch programming language

Hi! I made Bresenham's line algorithm inside of a single batch file. This took around 2.5 days to write all of the code, do all of the research needed, fix bugs and other things that you need to do in order to create something.

I know this has a shit-ton of bugs. But i dont feel like solving them so i did the easy solution and just added error messages for the glitches i could find.

I beleve this is only runnable on Windows 10 and 11

# How to use
1. Edit the file and change the X1 X2 Y1 Y2 to the 2 points you want to draw a line between. X1 and Y1 is for the first point, X2 and Y2 is for the second point.
2. Run the file and fix any errors in how your position variables are written
